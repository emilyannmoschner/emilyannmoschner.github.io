            <p>I'm Emily Ann Moschner.</p> 
            
            <p>I was raised on the sunny side of a street in Port Richey, Florida. As a child my hands were often hidden in journals, my nose was likely found in a book. Somewhere along the way, anything I could create or transform with my fingers became my newest beloved project. Now Iâ€™m a journalism student at the University of Florida trying to weave all of my fascinations, many vibrant, loose-ended threads, into a beautifully cohesive tapestry.</p>

<p>A journalist by trade and a visual communicator by heart, my view of the future is slowly coming into focus. Somewhere in there I'll be merging nonprofits and visual/written communication, but in the meantime, I call Gainesville my fake home and gather bits of experience and baubles of knowledge.</p>
