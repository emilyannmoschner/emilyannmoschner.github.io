            <p>Welcome! I’m Emily Ann.</p>

            <p>As a child my hands were often   hidden in journals, my nose was likely found in a book. Somewhere along the way, anything I could create or transform with my fingers became my newest beloved project. Now I’m a journalism student in Florida trying to weave all of my fascinations, many vibrant, loose-ended threads, into a beautifully cohesive tapestry.</p>

            <p>This is my visual, virtual journal where I sort out countless frazzled thoughts, piece together heaps of tangled assignments and undertakings, and gather bits of inspiration like a basket of berries. If it’s anything like the journals I schlep with me each day, the cover will bear signs of tearing and pages will spill onto the floor, but I’m ok with that.</p>

            <p>Thanks for dropping by, just please pardon the mess.</p>
