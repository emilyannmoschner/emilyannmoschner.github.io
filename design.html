            <h3>DESIGN Q & A</h3>    
            <p>Justin Galicz is a fellow journalism student at the Univeristy of Florida, and, like me, he does freelance graphic design work.</p> 
            
            <p>Right off the bat, you know Justin has style. I met him back in mulitmedia reporting class and his aesthetic continues to stick out in my mind when I think of other graphic designers in the J-school.</p>

<p>I decided to ask him some questions about his inspiration and process, his joy and history when it comes to graphic design. Check it out.</p>
                
        <p><em><strong>When did you become interested in graphic design? 
Why?</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>I became interested in graphic design the freshman year of high school. I was on yearbook staff, and at the end of the year we all had to create a mock yearbook. This was the first real design experience I ever had. I was completely in charge of the aesthetics, and I just fell in love with organizing information in a visually pleasing way. After that project, I realized I was pretty good at it, so I learned everything I could from older students and just absorbed every and all design around me.</p>
                
        <p><em><strong>How would you describe your process from the inception of an idea to the completion of a project?</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>The hardest part is the idea. A lot of the time I just stare at a blank computer screen thinking, analyzing and waiting for inspiration. I sometimes have to sketch out an idea or doodle it to see if it would even work. Most often though, I get my ideas when I'm lying in bed trying to sleep. When I have a project I am working on, my mind just cycles through every possibility, and then I have to get out of bed and scribble them down so I don't forget. When working, I go through a lot of trial and error. There is no perfect formula, so I continually manipulate and alter things to get the best result. So ultimately, I think for a long time, create a bunch of different designs, and then pick what I like the best and use that.
 </p>
                
        <p><em><strong>How have you incorporated graphic design in your professional goals?</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>Design is more than just creating posters and logos. It is creating visual hierarchy, anticipating how the viewer will react and guiding them through a visual path. Design is organizing information in a clear and easily digestible manner so the viewer can get the most amount of information with the least amount of effort. So with that in mind, I apply design to everything I do. A lot of what I am doing now is writing and multimedia, so I apply the principle of good design by writing compactly and using simple, well-established shots in my videos. Luckily, this summer I will be interning at the Orlando Sentinel as a graphics and web intern, so I will be doing real-world and hands-on design work. I will be optimizing print stories for the website and bringing stories to life with interactive and immersive graphics.

        <p><em><strong>Give us three tips for beginning designers. Please.</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>One of the most important things you can do as a beginner is copy other people's work. I know it sounds bad, but like with learning any new skill, copying is the basis on which you develop. You will be able to see why a design works, how the designer created it and then use that knowledge base to develop your own craft. Look for inspiration everywhere. Good design surrounds us. Bad design surrounds us. Take it all in and learn what makes a design effective and work. Design is as much about skills as it is taste. I'm really not that great with the software, but I know what looks good and why. You can teach someone to use a program or tool, but you can't teach them taste level.
 </p>
        <p><em><strong>Describe your experience with graphic design and your dream design-related job.</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>I've been designing since high school. I was on yearbook all four years. Senior year I was an Editor-in-Chief and overlooked the entire design of the book. We won a Pacemaker and Gold Crown for that book, which solidified it as one of the best 11 high school yearbooks in the country. Now that I am in college, I do more logo and brand work. I've done work for friends, clubs and organizations. Currently, I am the lead designer for the WUFT News Weekly iPad app, which we have created using a program called Mag+. It is really interesting because it takes the traditional form of print and gives it the unlimited freedom that the internet has. </p>
            <p>My dream job, at this point in my life, is to be a high school teacher. I was so inspired by my yearbook advisor, that I want to do for kids what she did for me. I would love to teach journalism and graphic design and be the advisor of the newspaper and yearbook. Journalism and design are vital skills that force one to think critically and abstractly. They made me who I am today, and I'd like to do the same for future generations. However, that is a couple of years away. I want to gain some real-world experience at a newsroom or magazine, doing the layout for either print or online. I love the news, and I would love to help others love the news. I've always said that I want to make news look pretty. That way people will actually read the work that amazing journalists are out there doing. </p>
                
        <p><em><strong>What or who inspires your design?</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>I am very inspired by data visualization. As a designer and journalist, I foremost have to tell a compelling story. With info design though, you have to consolidate so much extraneous information into a simplified graphic. That is why my design work is clean, simple and minimal. I want everything in my design to have a role and be important to the overall effect. </p>
                
        <p><em><strong>What is your favorite design tool?</strong></em></p>
            
        <p>My favorite design tool would have to be the internet. I constantly use it to search for new ideas and inspirations. Several times a day I am browsing through this Pinterest-style website called Designpiration. With the Internet, I am able to instantly share and receive. And most importantly, I am able to make things interactive, which creates an immersive experience that engages the audience and makes them excited to look at the design.</p>

        <p> P.S. In 2012, Justin interned with <a href="http://www.parisleaf.com/" target="_blank">Parisleaf</a>, a local design and printing firm in Gainesville, Florida. Not only is their work awesome, they've got a really earth-lovin' perspective on how their pieces could affect the environment. Watch this video to learn more about how they have committed to protecting the earth through eco-friendly printing.
